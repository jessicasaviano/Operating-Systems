Created a git repository to work on OS programming assignments and have individual folders for each assignment. We met in person 
for several hours (attended office hours in Rice as well) and both pushed and pulled code from the repository to make contributions.
 We primarily work together talking through and working on the segments together. We also attended zoom office hours together.
