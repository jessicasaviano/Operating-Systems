Created a git repository to work on this assignment and future OS programming assignments. We met in person 
for several hours (attended office hours in Rice as well) and both pushed and pulled code from the repository to make contributions.
 We primarily work together talking through and working on the segments together. Jessica also went to professor OH to understand the 
 outline of the project, and to understand Malloc.
